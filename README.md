Hello all, I m Anshu and I am a 3rd year CS Major at Cal State Monterey Bay
I enjoy playing soccer and chess on the weekends(an unusual combo I know)
I m currently just tipping my toes in game development, make a simple 3D platformer and the next thing you know I m making a AAA  Action-Adventure MMORPG.
